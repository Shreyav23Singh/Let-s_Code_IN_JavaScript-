Call , Apply and Bind are the three methods in javaScript that are used to set the this keyword independently how the function is called . 
The bind method creates a copy of the function and set the this keyword while call , apply set the this keyword and call the function immediately .

Call is a function that helps you change the context of the invoking function. In other words, it helps you replace the value of this inside a function with
whatever value you want.

Apply is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an array as an argument list.

Bind is a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later with the new context of this that is provided.
